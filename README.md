// The programme will have to ask the user for the amoun of km he wants to do and his age

//I need to create a variable let kmUser and assign value with a form transformed to a numnber
//I need to create a variable let passengerAge and assign value with a form transformed to a numnber

//Then use kmUser to calculate ticketPrice calculated with = kmUser * 0,21 (price per km)

//Apply a discount of 20% if the user is <18 years price = price * 0.8
//Apply a discount of 40% if the user is >65 years = price * 0.6
